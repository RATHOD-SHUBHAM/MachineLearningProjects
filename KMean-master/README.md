# KMean

k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations
into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with 
the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. 
This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells. It is popular for cluster analysis in data mining.

In this Task . we learn to use KMean algorithm using Python.
